How to make the font nice and big: Use the in-world editing tool linked to the key T 
(square with blue verticies) to expand the text as much as possible. As you do this,
make the text size larger. Then scale it down with the in-world editing tool linked to the key R.

I downloaded a directory of male and female images.

I was begining to put white hex's over the images but have instead decided to do it in runtime which seems more reasonable.
Wow! I got amazing text using the UI Text. I need to stick with that option. I planned out all my scenes and I am now coding a 
random image display script.

I wasn't able to fix the image displays so I will work on the buttons instead.

Trying to put time back into this project. I have a random name generator. Next step is to make the image random and save the data correctly.
Then I will work to save a memory, and then load it.
